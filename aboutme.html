        <h2>Sydney Palmer</h2>
        <p>I'm currently on my last semester in Software Engineering. I'm taking this class mainly because I needed one more credit to graduate, but I also love web development, so I thought why not. If all goes according to plan, I will be graduating at the end of this semester.</p>
      <p>
        I love to read and write fantasy and sci-fi. I'm quite creative and in my spare time love to make jewelry and crochet. I love coding fun things, but not typical games. For example, I'm currently working on an app called Storyteller which allows users to read and write stories and share them with others as well as add onto stories of others; this app is based on a childhood game my family used to play.

        I'm married (about 3.5 yars) and have one child. My husband graduated as a Mechanical Engineer. My son, Josh, is almost 8 months old. He completely wants to skip the crawling phase and start walking; he hates tummy time, but will walk with help when holding onto things.
      </p>

        I originally wanted to have a career, but after I had my kid, I realized that I really just want to be a stay at home mom. I would prefer to have acasual job that I can do at home, something where I'm coding, maybe making apps.
